# Variables

Template variables are the dynamic data passed to Postmark templates when sending notifications. The plugin ensures that all required variables are generated and validated before sending.

## Generation
- Variables are generated by the notification data workflow based on the cart, customer, and reminder schedule context.
- Each template may require different variables, which are validated before sending.

## Validation
- The plugin uses Postmark's template validation endpoint to check for missing variables.
- If required variables are missing, the notification is not sent and an error is logged.

## Usage
- Variables are passed as the `TemplateModel` when sending templated emails through Postmark.
- Ensure your templates reference only variables that are provided by the workflow.
